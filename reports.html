	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
		Cascade Microtech is a company located in Portland, Oregon 
	and manufactures test equipment for semiconductors. Cascade 
	Microtech customers include Intel, IBM, Nvidia, and Harvard 
	University. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In the last few years the company has had a series of acquisitions. 
	In January 2010 Cascade acquired SUSS MicroTec AG’s chip-testing 
	division for $9.8 million, which had been Cascade’s largest rival. 
	Cascade posted revenues of $113 for fiscal year 2012 and had its 
	first profit that year since 2007. In October 2013, the company 
	bought ATT Advanced Temperature Test Systems in a cash and stock deal 
	valued at $27.7 million. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In Q2 the company announced its MeasureOne strategic initiative. 
	The strategic initiative allows Cascade Microtech customers to 
	access an archive of validated test and measurement solutions, 
	which will reduce the initial measurement of their devices and 
	processes. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Financials</h3>
	
	<h5>Fundamentals</h5>
	<p>
	Cascade Microtech currently trades at 1.51x book value per 
	share(BVPS). BVPS is $6.24 while the current price of the security 
	is $9.53. This is comparable to Teradyne, the largest competitor 
	in the space, who trades at 1.5x BVPS. However, EBITDA/R demonstrates 
	how Cascade Microtech is undervalued. Cascade Microtech has an 
	EBITDA/R of 0.98x, which is significantly lower than the EBITDA/R 
	of 1.69x of Teradyne. As a result, if one takes into account 
	Cascade Microtech’s price-to-book-value, which is similar to the 
	industry leader, demonstrates how undervalued Cascade Microtech is.   
	</p>
	
	<h5>Profitability </h5>
	<p>
	In the most recent quarter (MRQ), Cascade Microtech posted record 
	gross margin of 50.8%.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Liquidity</h5> 
	<p>
	According to the MRQ, Cascade Microtech boasts a current ratio of 4.38x. 
	This is impressive as Cascade Microtech has boosted R&D expenditure. 
	In addition, it is relatively higher when compared to Teradyne’s current 
	ratio of 3.75x.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Management Effectiveness</h5>  
	<p>
	Cascade Microtech’s management, under Michael Burger, has brought the 
	company to profitability. This is seen with Cascade’s return on assets 
	and return on equity. Compared to Teradyne, Cascade’s management is more 
	effective in executing strategy. For the trailing twelve months, Return 
	on Assets(ROA) is 6.31% and Return on Equity (ROE) is 16.22% for Cascade 
	Microtech, while Teradyne has been 5.66% and 9.78%, respectively.
