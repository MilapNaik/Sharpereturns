Cascade Microtech customers include Intel, IBM, Nvidia, and Harvard University. In the last few years the company has had a series of acquisitions. In January 2010 Cascade acquired SUSS MicroTec AG’s chip-testing division for $9.8 million, which had been Cascade’s largest rival. Cascade posted revenues of $113 for fiscal year 2012 and had its first profit that year since 2007. In October 2013, the company bought ATT Advanced Temperature Test Systems in a cash and stock deal valued at $27.7 million. In Q2 the company announced its MeasureOne strategic initiative. The strategic initiative allows Cascade Microtech customers to access an archive of validated test and measurement solutions, which will reduce the initial measurement of their devices and processes. FinancialsFundamentalsCascade Microtech currently trades at 1.51x book value per share(BVPS). BVPS is $6.24 while the current price of the security is $9.53. This is comparable to Teradyne, the largest competitor in the space, who trades at 1.5x BVPS. However, EBITDA/R demonstrates how Cascade Microtech is undervalued. Cascade Microtech has an EBITDA/R of 0.98x, which is significantly lower than the EBITDA/R of 1.69x of Teradyne. As a result, if one takes into account Cascade Microtech’s price-to-book-value, which is similar to the industry leader, demonstrates how undervalued Cascade Microtech is.   Profitability In the most recent quarter (MRQ), Cascade Microtech posted record gross margin of 50.8%. Liquidity According to the MRQ, Cascade Microtech boasts a current ratio of 4.38x. This is impressive as Cascade Microtech has boosted R&D expenditure. In addition, it is relatively higher when compared to Teradyne’s current ratio of 3.75x.Management Effectiveness  Cascade Microtech’s management, under Michael Burger, has brought the company to profitability. This is seen with Cascade’s return on assets and return on equity. Compared to Teradyne, Cascade’s management is more effective in executing strategy. For the trailing twelve months, Return on Assets(ROA) is 6.31% and Return on Equity (ROE) is 16.22% for Cascade Microtech, while Teradyne has been 5.66% and 9.78%, respectively. 	There are currently a slew of prominent institutional investors who own the stock as well.
